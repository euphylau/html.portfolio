<h1>The Best Movies According to Euphy</h1> 

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2> 

<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>

<p>This my first impression about wizard and I love it. When i saw thousands of candles floating on the ceiling, it is impressing.</p>

<h3>All for the Winner</h3>

<p>It is my favourite Stephen Chow movie which is exactly what Hong Kong style comedy in my mind.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>

<p>The animation movie has deep meaning and beautiful scenes.</p>
